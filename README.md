# Project Happy - Take happyness to the world

## Simple project to practice Typescript and ReactJS

This is a web client to get data from a NodeJS API and show all the orphanages 
in a location with info about visit schedule, and address.

## Docker ready
To avoid the need to install Node in version 12.18.4, it comes a docker-compose.yml file,
so just run the docker compose and inside bash run the **npm start**.

```
docker-compose run --rm --service-ports dev
```
